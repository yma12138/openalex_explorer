# OpenAlex Explorer

An agent skill, LLM-powered automated literature review pipeline: search papers via OpenAlex, screen for relevance & quality, extract summaries, and write structured reviews.

## How It Works

After registering this skill, you simply **tell your AI agent what you want to research**, and it handles the rest — searching academic papers, screening for relevance and quality, extracting summaries, and writing a structured review.

The pipeline:

1. **Keyword Generation** — AI brainstorms search keywords from your question
2. **Adaptive Search** — Searches [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/) with async parallelism
3. **Relevance & Quality Screening** — Two-stage LLM filtering
4. **Structured Summaries** — Extracts key findings
5. **Review Writing** — Topic clustering → parallel chapter writing → citation validation

You can also just build a literature database without writing a summaries
Note that this skill *DOESNOT* read the full paper, so it's only suitable for exploration, but this feature also make it token-efficient and fast
## Install
Download this skill,then just tell your AI agent something like:

> *"Read SKILL.md,Install this Skill"*

The agent will read the skill definition, ask you for any missing details, configure the JSON spec,then you can use it.

## Manual CLI Usage (Optional)

You can also run the pipeline directly:

```bash
# Build the paper database
python3 build_db.py specs/my_review.json

# Write the review
python3 write_review.py output/My_Review_20260708_120000/

# Manage sessions
python3 manage.py list
python3 manage.py export 0
```
